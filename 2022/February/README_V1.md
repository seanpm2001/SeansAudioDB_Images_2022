# Some context

## 2022 February 2nd

I turned the Wi-Fi connection off on my Raspberry Pi last night, as I wanted to work without Internet. I found out the next day that the Raspberry Pi has no internal clock, and just continued from the shutdown at around 10:00 pm last night. However, I didn't fix it until I noticed the issue at 3:00 pm PST, when the clock hit midnight, over 4 hours after I started audio metadata additions.
